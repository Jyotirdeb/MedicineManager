Medicine Manager is an Android application that allows the user to take their medicines at the scheduled time.
It also has an inbuilt medicine directory to help you with your dosages.
Medicine Manager acts like an alarm to notify you about the time to take your medicine.
Medicine Manager also has a called multi users where each user can set their medicines and when the time comes the user will get notification to take their medicines.

<b>Note:</b> Medicine Manager is a completely free and open-source app, developed as a hobby on free time by me.  I earn no money from this app, and I have zero interest in your personal data.
